# necllmancer

## Overview

"necllmancer" is a novel platform that coordinates multiple Large Language Models (LLM) instances to efficiently accomplish complex tasks. Each LLM instance undertakes specific roles and tasks, contributing to an integrated work environment. The system is designed to allow users to visually track each instance's tasks through an interactive interface, offering guidance as needed.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide an environment where AI instances collaborate to handle more complex and diverse tasks efficiently. It functions as a virtual workspace, facilitating cooperation among multiple AI instances under human supervision.

## Features

- **Instance Role Assignment**: Each LLM instance is assigned specific roles, such as 'supervisor' or 'worker'.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can visualize the progress of each instance's tasks in real-time through the interface. This interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing for easy comprehension of each instance's status.
- **User Intervention**: Users can issue instructions to instances via the interface, altering task priorities as needed.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The system monitors the performance of each instance, providing feedback to users.
